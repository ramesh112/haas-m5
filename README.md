Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?
Predictive Analysis and Visualization Project

**Overview**
This project analyzes factors influencing drivers’ decisions to accept or reject mobile coupons received while driving. The dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, consists of survey responses from individuals exposed to various coupon and contextual driving scenarios.

The main goal is to explore and visualize differences between those who accept the coupons and those who do not, using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn). This project serves as a public portfolio piece demonstrating data exploration, visualization, and insight communication.

**Data Description**
The dataset (coupons.csv) records responses to hypothetical driving scenarios. Each row represents a scenario in which a driver receives a coupon, and the respondent chooses whether or not to accept it.

**Attribute Groups**

User Attributes
Gender, Age, Marital Status, Children, Education, Occupation, Annual Income
Frequency of bar visits, take-away food, coffee house, and restaurant visits

**Contextual Attributes**
Driving destination, travel companion (passenger), weather, temperature, time of day
Geographical proximity and directionality to the coupon location

**Coupon Attributes**
Coupon type: restaurant (<$20, $20–$50), coffee house, bar, carryout/takeaway Time before coupon expiration

Label

Y (1 = will accept coupon, 0 = will not accept coupon)

**Project Tasks**

The analysis process includes:

Loading and Inspecting Data
Read the coupon dataset using Pandas.
Preview and clean as needed.
Data Exploration
Explore distributions of key features, including acceptance rates, user demographics, and coupon types.
Identify important factors affecting coupon acceptance.

**Statistical Visualizations**
Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create plots illustrating differences between those who accept and those who decline coupons.

Suggested plots: bar charts of acceptance by context (weather, time, passenger), boxplots of numeric features, etc.

Summary and Insights

Report on the most significant factors impacting coupon acceptance, supported by your visualizations.

Discuss implications, limitations, and suggestions for further analysis.
